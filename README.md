# Transfer-of-materials-in-FMS-using-Drones: prototype suitability study

This dissertation seeks to provide an effective solution for the use of Drones to transfer materials
and components inside Processing Systems. The main goal is to select the appropriate components
and model a Drone, which will be able to operate automatically in a specified environment and carry
a piece of weight up to 2 kg between the necessary machine tools.

The first part of the work deals initially with a bibliographic search on current research topics. The
evolution of Drones technology in recent years is presented, the various commercial Drones availa-
ble are mapped and their uses are examined in general, and more specifically in the industrial envi-
ronment, while then, specific elements of modern processing systems are being presented, and both
these fields are getting connected This is essentially an introduction to the issues under investiga-
tion.

The second part of the work is the main part of the engineering study. Initially, the components that
will make up the Drone which will be used as a means of transport are selected. This selection is
based on the use of eCalc, an online tool that has an extensive database of remote-controlled devic-
es and has the ability to perform calculations based on specific electrical and mechanical compo-
nents, with values given by the user and through specific equations, to find the appropriate built for
every situation. The flight simulation of the Drone, developed using Matlab and Simulink software, is
then recorded. The results of the research are presented through diagrams of the Drone's response
to specific given three-dimensional trajectories and the achievement of the goal for the smooth
transfer of objects is shown. Finally, the way in which the produced industrial parts can be tied and
deposited will be explored and a basic solution will be designed using CAD software.

In the 3rd part of the work, the overall inventory of the research is made, the conclusions are report-
ed and ways are proposed, for the further development of the research.

The dissertation has been written by Gerasimos Maltezos, under the supervision of Professor George-Christophoros Vosniakos, as a Diploma Thesis of the author for his studies in Mechanical Engineering, NTUA. The language of the dissertation is Greek.
